# Exploring Python design Patterns
I am using [Python Design Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/) as a guide. After this, I am hoping to find a related book on the topic. 

## Purpose 
Over the past year I spend a lot of time learning python's ins and outs. However, with that knowledge, I also gained a breath of ways for accomplishing common tasks. By learning some common design patterns, I am hoping to develop a standard for approaching some tasks. With this, I am also hoping to write cleaner and structured programs.
